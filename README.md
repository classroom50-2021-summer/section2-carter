# CS50 Section 2 - Spreading wings :baby_chick:
<b>TF:</b> Carter Zenke | <b>Time: </b>Tuesday, 5pm ET, June 29, 2021 | With :sparkling_heart: for those feeling less comfortable.

<b>Goals:</b> Welcome to Carter's CS50 Section! This first section will introduce you to your section mates, engage you in discussion about how to complete the week's problem sets, and help you develop your mastery of C's <i>syntax</i> (the structure or "grammar" with which we write C code). Afterwards, you should feel that you've already started making progress towards completing the problem sets for the week.

<b>Resources:</b> This repository offers several programs that you will modify during section, serving both as a place for deliberate practice and as a reference as you continue to work on the week's problem sets. In addition to the materials here, you will later have access to the collaborative notes we generate during section.

<b>Before section:</b> Please be sure that you've watched most or all of Lecture 2 - Arrays! No other prior knowledge necessary. 

## Agenda (90 minutes)
#### Welcome (10 minutes): :hugs:
- <b>Check ins with our community</b> | 5 to 7 minutes
	- How did the first week go?
	- What were our triumphs? Frustrations?
- <b>Problem set overviews</b> | 5 minutes | TF-led presentation + Q&A
	- What are we doing in Readability?
	- What are we doing in Caesar and Substitution?
	- What concepts will help us solve these problems?

#### Deliberate problem set practice (60 - 70 minutes): :wrench:
- <b>Functions (Inputs, Outputs, Return Values)</b> | 20 minutes | <i>in 2-3 person groups, with large-group share out</i>
	- Engage with code in "function_definitions.c" and "argv.c". These programs help us think about:
	    - What does it mean for a function to have an _argument_ and a _return value_?
	    - How do we get and use arguments we give to our programs at the terminal?
- <b>Searching strings</b> | 30 minutes | <i>in 2-3 person groups, with large-group share out</i>
	- Engage with "haiku_0.c" to "haiku_3.c"
		- How should we check to see what characters exist in a string?
		- How this strategy help us make inferences about a text?
- <b>Scrambling strings</b> | 10 minutes | <i>in 2-3 person groups, with large-group share out</i>
	- Engage with "scrambled_haiku.c"
		- How are characters represented in the ASCII format?
		- How can we use the ASCII format to scramble text, such that it becomes encrypted?
		- What are the pitfalls we should watch out for when manipulating ASCII values?

#### Forecasting the "week" (5 minutes): :partly_sunny:
- <b>Problem sets</b> | 5 minutes | TF-led demonstration + Q&A
	- How much time should I plan to spend on them?
	- How should I seek help?

#### Open questions (30+ minutes after section): :thinking:
- <b>Open Q&A with TF and other classmates!</b>
